			<br>
			<p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to
				accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such
				as: analysis, generating algorithms,profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the
				implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2]
				The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers,
				rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of
				programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which
				can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient
				programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the
				application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>
